# Solidity API

## TokenInfo

_ERC20 standard interface does not specify these functions, but
     often the token implementations have them._

### name

```solidity
function name() external view returns (string)
```

_Returns the name of the token._

### symbol

```solidity
function symbol() external view returns (string)
```

_Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name._

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() external view returns (uint8)
```

_Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if &#x60;decimals&#x60; equals &#x60;2&#x60;, a balance of &#x60;505&#x60; tokens should
be displayed to a user as &#x60;5,05&#x60; (&#x60;505 / 10 ** 2&#x60;).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless {_setupDecimals} is
called.

NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
{IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}._
